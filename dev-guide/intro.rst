Introduction
------------

coreERP is a web based application that is built on the Linux open stack. Although it was originally designed and
conceptualised as a windows application, the new architecture is entirely built on various open source products with
a Linux server as the host. coreERP was always designed with the intention of being a business application. It has matured
over a period of time. 

When it comes to business applications, change is the only constant. Keeping this in mind, the 
architects of coreERP created pluggable modules that can be developed and plugged in independent of one another. To achieve 
maximum adaptability to the ever changing business requirements, a Xml based framework has been developed. The application 
relies on this framework to render the gui. All these aspects including how to setup the development environment will be 
discussed in this developer guide.

You are expected to know the following languages and technologies to start development on coreERP

    - PHP
    - XML
    - Java script
    - PostgreSQL - TSQL and pgsql

A basic working knowledge should suffice to start with. The following chapters start with the setup of development environment
and then explain the structure of coreERP. We take a case study and build a simple module to understand the different parts of 
coreERP.
