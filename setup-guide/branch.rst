Branch
======

A branch is a physical unit of the business entity that is situated in a geographic region clearly distinguished from other physical units of the same business entity. It maintains an independent set of books of accounts for recording all business transactions. However, it uses the Chart of Accounts, Inventory Stock Codes, Customers, Suppliers of the business entity.

In CoreERP, all transactions are recorded at a branch level. You can create and post transactions on in a branch. Do note that the corporate/head office is also a branch in CoreERP. This is usually the first branch that is created.
