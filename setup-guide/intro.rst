Introduction
------------

CoreERP is a web based application that is built on the Linux open stack. Although it was originally designed and
conceptualised as a windows application, the new architecture is entirely built on various open source products with
a Linux server as the host. CoreERP was always designed with the intention of being a business application. It has matured
over a period of time. 

This document would guide you through the entire setup process of CoreERP and also demonstrate how to create users, roles, company, branches, etc. This guide is required to be read and followed by a System Administrator or any user who wants to setup CoreERP and use it in test or production environment. Each step has been detailed with great care to ensure that the commands work on a Ubuntu 14.04LTS server.

If CoreERP has already been setup by your administrator, please refer to the **User Guide** to start using the application. You would also require the username and password assigned to you by the system administrator.
