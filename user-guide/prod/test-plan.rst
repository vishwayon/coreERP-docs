Test Plan
---------

A Test Plan is a template that is created to put together various tests that would be conducted on a specific stock item or a group of materials.
Individual tests are grouped together in a test plan. It consists of 2 distinct types of test groups.

-   Standard Tests
    All tests grouped together as standard test should be completed before the material/stock item is Accepted/Rejected

-   Additional Tests
    Any of the additional tests can be selected by the user and applied to a material/stock item during Test/Inspection

Click on the menu *Production -> Masters -> Test Plan*.

A collection screen appears. Click on the *+ New* button.
